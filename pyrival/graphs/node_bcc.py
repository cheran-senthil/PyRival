REMARK: There are two definitions of biconnectedness of an undirected graph, 
        either node-bcc or edge-bcc, corresponding to node_bcc.py and edge_bcc.py.

* In node-bcc, a "cut-vertex" (also called an articulation point) is a node where 
  removing it would split up the graph into multiple connected components.

* In edge-bcc, a "bridge" is an edge where removing it would split up the graph 
  into multiple connected components.

For example, this graph

  1   4   7   10
 / \ / \ / \ /
2   0   5   9
 \ / \ / \ /
  3   6   8

has three cut vertices (nodes 0,5,9) and one bridge (edge between 9 and 10).
The number of node-bcc = 4 and number of edge-bcc = 2.
Note that a node belongs to multiple node-bccs iff it is a cut-vertex.
"""

"""
Given an undirected graph, find_BCC returns a list of lists containing the nodes 
of the different node-biconnected components.
Node-biconnected components are maximal subgraphs that cannot be disconnected
by removing a single node.
Note that a node belongs to multiple node-bccs iff it is an articulation point.
