REMARK: There are two definitions of biconnectedness of an undirected graph, 
        either node-bcc or edge-bcc, corresponding to node_bcc.py and edge_bcc.py.

* In node-bcc, a "cut-vertex" (also called an articulation point) is a node where 
  removing it would split up the graph into multiple connected components.

* In edge-bcc, a "bridge" is an edge where removing it would split up the graph 
  into multiple connected components.

For example, this graph

  1   4   7   10
 / \ / \ / \ /
2   0   5   9
 \ / \ / \ /
  3   6   8

has three cut vertices (nodes 0,5,9) and one bridge (edge between 9 and 10).
The number of node-bcc = 4 and number of edge-bcc = 2.
Note that a node belongs to multiple node-bccs iff it is a cut-vertex.
"""


# Edge-bcc uses pyrival's scc.py as a subroutine
"""
Given a directed graph, find_SCC returns a list of lists containing 
the strongly connected components in topological order.

Note that this implementation can be also be used to check if a directed graph is a
DAG, and in that case it can be used to find the topological ordering of the nodes.

Given an undirected simple graph, find_BCC returns a list of lists 
containing the edge biconnected components of the graph (i.e. no bridges).
In a biconnected component, any two nodes are connected by at least two
edge-disjoint paths.
Runs in O(n + m) time.
